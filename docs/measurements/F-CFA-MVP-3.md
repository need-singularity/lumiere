| **Trigger** | `p95 > 4 MB → retract compression target` |
| **Hardware** | iPhone 15 Pro · 12 MP capture |

## Pre-declared expected outcome

> Expected: does not fire (Wallace 1991 quantization tables + 12 MP at qf 85 typically 3–4 MB for natural scenes).
> — spec §19.2 raw 71 falsifiers (5)

## Notes

- Measurement script: [`scripts/measure_jpeg_size.sh`](../../scripts/measure_jpeg_size.sh) — uses macOS `sips` against `Tests/fixtures/jpeg-12mp/` (fixture set TBD). `sips` is NOT the iPhone 15 Pro on-device JPEG encoder; real measurement needs `AVCapturePhotoOutput` round-trip on device.
